# Icarus SDK Alignment with Specification

This document confirms the alignment of the Icarus SDK implementation with the ICARUS_SPEC.md.

## ‚úÖ Architectural Compliance

### Three-Project Separation
- **icarus-sdk**: Contains ONLY library code (traits, types, macros)
- **icarus-cli**: Separate project containing CLI tool and bridge service binaries
- **icarus-marketplace**: Separate project for web platform

### SDK Scope (Correctly Implemented)
- ‚úÖ icarus-core: Core abstractions and traits
- ‚úÖ icarus-derive: Procedural macros
- ‚úÖ icarus-canister: ICP canister integration
- ‚úÖ icarus-test: Testing utilities
- ‚úÖ icarus-types: Protocol types (formerly icarus-bridge, now just types)
- ‚úÖ icarus: Main SDK crate that re-exports everything

### What's NOT in SDK (Correctly Excluded)
- ‚ùå CLI binary (icarus command) - in icarus-cli project
- ‚ùå Bridge service binary - in icarus-cli project
- ‚ùå Marketplace integration
- ‚ùå Business logic
- ‚ùå Hardcoded canister IDs

## ‚úÖ Technical Implementation

### rmcp Integration
- All IcarusTool types produce rmcp::Tool
- IcarusServer extends rmcp::ServerHandler
- Full MCP protocol compatibility

### Memory Server Example
- Implements all 4 required tools:
  - `memorize`: Store memories with tags
  - `forget`: Remove memories by ID
  - `recall`: Search memories by query
  - `list`: List all memories with optional limit

### Dependencies
- Updated to latest versions:
  - rmcp 0.2.1
  - ic-cdk 0.18.5
  - All other dependencies current

## üìã Key Design Decisions

1. **Renamed icarus-bridge to icarus-types**: Since the bridge service was moved to icarus-cli, this crate now only contains protocol types for SDK use.

2. **No executable code in SDK**: The SDK is purely a library that developers compile into their applications.

3. **Clear separation of concerns**: Each project has distinct responsibilities with no overlap.

## üöÄ Next Steps

The SDK is now fully compliant with the specification. Developers can:

1. Add `icarus = "0.1"` to their Cargo.toml
2. Use the provided macros to build MCP servers
3. Deploy to ICP using standard dfx commands
4. Use the separate icarus-cli for developer tooling

The bridge service and CLI commands are provided by the icarus-cli project, maintaining the clean architectural boundaries defined in the specification.
