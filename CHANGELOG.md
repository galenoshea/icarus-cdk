## [0.5.7] - 2025-09-08

### Fixed
- **Universal Candid Decoding**: The MCP-ICP bridge can now decode ANY Rust function return type
  - Added dynamic `IDLArgs` decoding to handle complex nested types
  - Fixed parameter encoding for multiple arguments (no longer encoded as tuples)
  - Supports `Result<Vec<T>, E>`, custom structs, enums, and all Candid types
  - Converts any `IDLValue` to JSON representation for Claude Desktop compatibility

### Changed
- **Enhanced `icarus deploy`**: Now builds WASM, extracts Candid interface, and optimizes with ic-wasm
  - Automatically runs candid-extractor to update .did file with all tool functions
  - Applies ic-wasm optimizations to reduce binary size
  - Shows build output for transparency

## [0.5.6] - 2025-09-08

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed `icarus build` command - use `dfx build` directly instead
  - Icarus now focuses solely on MCP bridge functionality
  - Eliminates duplicate build logic and potential inconsistencies
  - Removed 900+ lines of unnecessary code

### Changed  
- **Simplified `icarus deploy`**: Now directly calls `dfx deploy` and handles Claude Desktop configuration
  - Fixed race condition where wrong canister IDs were displayed after upgrade
  - Local deployments now always use current principal as init argument
- **Simplified dfx.json template**: Changed from `type: "custom"` to `type: "rust"`
  - dfx automatically handles Rust build configuration

  - `[package.metadata.icarus]` section for Claude Desktop integration
  - `[profile.release]` optimizations for smaller WASM binaries (60% size reduction)
  - Proper Cargo.toml metadata for all examples

### Fixed
- **dfx.json Generation**: Fixed incorrect paths and filenames:
  - Candid path now correctly points to `src/{name}.did`
  - WASM filename properly handles project names with hyphens (converts to underscores)
  - Added local network configuration with ephemeral type

### Changed

  - Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Configurable timeouts and response size limits
  - Automatic cycle cost management
  - ~420 lines of boilerplate eliminated per project
- **Timers Module**: Autonomous task scheduling for canisters
  - `timers::schedule_once()` for one-time delayed tasks
  - `timers::schedule_periodic()` for recurring operations
  - Timer registry with 100 timer limit for resource management

- **Parameter Encoding**: Bridge now correctly handles positional, record, and empty parameter styles
- **JSON to Candid Translation**: Seamless conversion regardless of how developers design tool parameters

### Changed

## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-06

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES
- **Renamed `get_metadata` to `list_tools`**: All canisters must be rebuilt with the new SDK version. The canister query endpoint for tool discovery has been renamed from `get_metadata()` to `list_tools()` for better MCP protocol alignment.

### Added
- **Fully Dynamic Bridge**: The bridge now dynamically discovers tools from canisters at runtime with zero hardcoded tool definitions
- **Workflow Documentation**: Added comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow documentation in `.github/workflows/README.md`

### Changed
- **Bridge Architecture**: Complete redesign to remove all hardcoded tools and implement true runtime discovery
- **Tool Discovery**: Renamed tool discovery endpoint from `get_metadata` to `list_tools` across entire codebase
- **CI/CD Workflows**: Reorganized and optimized GitHub Actions workflows for better maintainability

### Fixed
- **CI Workflow**: Removed duplicate concurrency block that was causing workflow validation errors
- **Bridge Tool Mismatch**: Fixed issue where bridge exposed phantom tools that didn't exist in canisters

### Migration Guide
To upgrade from 0.3.x to 0.4.0:
1. Update your `Cargo.toml` dependency to `icarus = "0.4.0"`
2. Rebuild your canister with `icarus build`
3. Redeploy with `icarus deploy`
4. The bridge will automatically use the new `list_tools()` endpoint
