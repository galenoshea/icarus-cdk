# Icarus SDK Scripts

This directory contains automation scripts for development and release workflows.

## Core Scripts

### üß™ `ci.sh`
**Purpose**: Optimized CI runner with parallel execution and comprehensive checks  
**Usage**: 
- `./scripts/ci.sh` - Run all checks (default)
- `./scripts/ci.sh fmt clippy test` - Run specific checks
- `./scripts/ci.sh -j 8 all` - Run with 8 parallel jobs
- `./scripts/ci.sh --coverage test` - Run tests with coverage
**When to use**: Before pushing changes to ensure CI will pass

**Options**:
- `-h, --help` - Show help message
- `-v, --verbose` - Enable verbose output
- `-q, --quiet` - Suppress non-error output
- `-j, --jobs NUM` - Number of parallel jobs
- `--no-cache` - Disable cargo cache
- `--no-fail-fast` - Continue on errors
- `--coverage` - Run with coverage enabled

**Commands**:
- `all` - Run all checks (format, clippy, tests, build, version)
- `fmt`, `format` - Check code formatting
- `clippy` - Run clippy lints
- `test` - Run all tests
- `build` - Build all targets
- `version` - Check version consistency

### üè• `health-check.sh`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive project health monitoring  
**Usage**: `./scripts/health-check.sh`  
**When to use**: Periodic project health assessment

**What it checks**:
- Environment setup and dependencies
- Project structure and organization
- Code quality metrics
- Build system health
- Test coverage status
- Git repository status
- CI/CD configuration
- Performance metrics

**Output**: Health score with grade (A+ to F) and recommendations

### üöÄ `release.sh`
**Purpose**: Create a new release with automatic version bumping  
**Usage**: 
- `./scripts/release.sh patch` - Bump patch version (0.2.1 ‚Üí 0.2.2)
- `./scripts/release.sh minor` - Bump minor version (0.2.1 ‚Üí 0.3.0)
- `./scripts/release.sh major` - Bump major version (0.2.1 ‚Üí 1.0.0)

**What it does**:
1. Checks for clean working directory
2. Checks version consistency across project
3. Runs all tests
4. Runs clippy checks
5. Uses cargo-release to bump versions (updates all version references)
6. Creates git commit and tag
7. Pushes to GitHub to trigger release workflow

### üîç `check-versions.sh`
**Purpose**: Verify all version references are consistent across the project  
**Usage**: `./scripts/check-versions.sh`  
**When to use**: Before releases or to verify version alignment

**What it checks**:
- Workspace and crate versions in Cargo.toml files
- Dependency examples in README files
- Version footers in documentation
- Migration guide version references
- CLI installation commands

**Integration**:
- Automatically run by CI on every push
- Called by release.sh before creating a release
- Returns exit code 0 if consistent, 1 if mismatches found

### üîß `install-hooks.sh`
**Purpose**: Install git hooks for automated quality checks  
**Usage**: `./scripts/install-hooks.sh`  
**When to use**: Once after cloning the repository

### üßπ `clean.sh`
**Purpose**: Deep clean all build artifacts, caches, and temporary files  
**Usage**: `./scripts/clean.sh [--non-interactive]`  
**When to use**: When you need to clean all build artifacts and start fresh

**What it does**:
1. Removes target directories (Rust build artifacts)
2. Cleans .dfx directories (ICP local network data)
3. Removes temporary test directories
4. Cleans node_modules if present
5. Removes other build artifacts and caches

**Options**:
- `--non-interactive`: Skip confirmation prompts (useful in CI)

## Git Hooks (Installed by install-hooks.sh)

### Pre-commit Hook
- Checks code formatting
- Runs clippy with warnings as errors
- Runs tests

### Pre-push Hook
- Runs full CI simulation via ci.sh
- Ensures all checks pass before push

## Quick Start for New Contributors

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/galenoshea/icarus-sdk.git
cd icarus-sdk

# 2. Install git hooks
./scripts/install-hooks.sh

# 3. Before pushing changes, test locally
./scripts/ci.sh

# 4. To create a release
./scripts/release.sh patch
```

## Script Maintenance

- All scripts should be executable (`chmod +x`)
- Use consistent error handling and colored output
- Keep scripts focused on a single purpose
- Document any external dependencies
